    <h1>My Flow</h1>
    <p> My flow is lifting weights. It is something that I have really come to enjoy, and it is probably my largest hobby.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>I lifted for the first time in middle school. However, I did not get really into it until around the beginning of Covid. With a lot of extra time on my hands, I began to learn a lot more about it, with the largest being the importance of nutrition.</p>

    <h3>Influences</h3>
    <p> When I began to get more into lifting, I started watching a few youtube channels that taught me quite a bit. </p>
