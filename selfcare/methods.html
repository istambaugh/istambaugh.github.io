    <h2> Music</h2>
    <p> Listening to (not creating!) music has been an integral part of my life for as long as I can remember. From country music to EDM, different genres of music have 'soundtracked' various stages in my life. Music has always been somewhat of a comfort
        to me, a way to 'tune out' from the rest of life for a little while.</p>

    <h3> Favorite Music </h3>
    <p> Out of all the music and genres I have listened to, one artist, Smino, stands out as my all time favorite. For pretty much all of middle school, I had his first album on repeat at all times. </p>

    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>Exercise for me is my primary method of self care. It is something that I do practically everyday, and provides a structure for my day-to-day life. Because nutrition is a large part of my favorite method of exercise, weight lifting, I dedicate a good
        amount of time everyday to focus on my meals.</p>
